# Data Analysis for Data Scientists

## Data Scientist's Guide: 
Finding the Best Places to work as a Data Scientist in the US Overview This project analyses, evaluates and identifies, the best places for data scientists to work in the United States. The assessment is based on median salary data obtained from the CareerOneStop API on city, state, and the national levels. Additionally, scatter plots are derived to analyze the correlation between employment growth and median salary.

The Geoapify API was used to create a heat map which allowed for a visualization of individual states' median salary across the nation. Further examination of these data points identified which states were to be considered the best places to work for data scientists. Additionally, an assessment of estimated employment vs projected employment was conducted to gain greater insight of the Data Scientist job market growth.

Key Features Include: Accessing free API's to fetch pertinent data https://api.careeronestop.org/api-explorer/home/index/Occupations_GetOccupationDetails https://apidocs.geoapify.com/playground/geocoding/ https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-state-total.html

Bar Plots: Median salary at the city, state, and national level, with the highest median salary in the top 10 states as the focal point. Scatter Plots: Analyze the correlation between employment growth and median salary through scatter plots.

Conclusive Analysis The results show the top 10 states with the highest median pay, and 17 cities located within those states. There was no recordable correlation between projected employment growth rate in an area and median salary. The data obtained was used to determine the states and cities with the highest salaries. These values were then compared that with the median salary of Data Scientists on the national level. The states that had the highest salaries also did not indicate higher projected job growth.
